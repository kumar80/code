I believe the only way of reaching a goal is through adopting a results-oriented attitude reflected in initiative and accountability, I used my time at university to develop these. I also gained hands-on quantitative, analytical, and problem-solving skills

I have relevant skills in c++, javascript, node.js,SQL, OOPS and also have somewhat sound knowledge in web development frameworks.

I believe my skills and experience would be an ideal match for this position. Please let me know any more details about my application or if you need any further details from me.

I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards
